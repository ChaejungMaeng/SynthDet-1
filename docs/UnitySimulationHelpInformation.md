# Unity Simulation troubleshooting
This is a guide for navigating issues in Unity Simulation that can block your workflow when using the SynthDet Sample Project.

## Run in Unity Simulation window

This section explains the Run in Unity Simulation window and the definitions of the parameters that SynthDet needs to create a Unity Simulation run:

## Parameters
You can refer to [Unity Simulation Randomization Parameters](UnitySimulationRandomizationParameters.md) 
doc for each randomization parameter definition.

## Unity Simulation can’t find my project
If Unity Simulation can’t find your execution ID in the active project you might need to activate the sample project in order to find your execution ID. This mainly applies if you have already used Unity Simulation with other projects.
